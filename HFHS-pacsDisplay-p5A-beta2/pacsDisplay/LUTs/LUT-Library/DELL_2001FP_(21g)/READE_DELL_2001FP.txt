In late 2005, dual monitor workstations with advanced
graphics boards were deployed at Henry Ford Health
System for use with 3D image analysis software.
The LUTs in this directory were used with the
'LUTsearch' feature of loadLUT for the first time
as a part of this project.

A GENERIC LUT was subsequently built using 18
of the 21 uLR data files. Those not used had
anomalous Lmin or Lmax properties and are marked
with an X at the end of the file name.
