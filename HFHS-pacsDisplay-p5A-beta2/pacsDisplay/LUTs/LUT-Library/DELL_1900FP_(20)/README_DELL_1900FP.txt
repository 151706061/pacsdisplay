Dell 1900FP 19" LCD monitors were used at Henry Ford Health System
in 2003 as a part of an enterprise PACS conversion project.
A large number of monitors were deployed in medical clinics and
within Radiology for use by technologists.

The library has a set of 20 uLR data files measured at the
beginning of  the project. At that time, a decision was made
not to generate and distribute a GENERIC LUT.
The variability in the uncalibrated luminance response as
illustrated by the plots in the library suggested that
a GENERIC calibration would not be possible. In fact, it
was found that application of a GENERIC table could make
the displayed characteristics worse.

This collection is included in the library only to
illustrate how an early generation Dell monitor had
variability problems that makes them unsuitable for enterprise
use where consistent appearance is important.
