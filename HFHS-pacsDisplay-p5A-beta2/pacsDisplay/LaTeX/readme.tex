\documentclass[10pt,letterpaper]{article}
% The document class is like the old tex version. Page size and font size are defined here. I try to use relative units for everything (ems instead of cms); that way they scale with the fonts. 

\input{input/preamble}

% There is a separate print.bat file included with the documentation. Running it will print
% the full manual and each section as a separate pdf. This should be done following
% any changes of the section files.

\begin{document}

% Put the title page and other frontmatter files here
% The \input command takes the other file and just inserts is verbatim. It is different
% from \include because \include does things like generate separate aux files and clearpage commands.
% I'm using the include command so I can use \includeonly to selectively print specific sections

\include{input/title}

% Include the section files below

\include{sections/install}
\include{sections/applications}
\include{sections/lumresponse}
\include{sections/lutgen}
\include{sections/loadlut}
\include{sections/lutlibrary}
\include{sections/edid}
