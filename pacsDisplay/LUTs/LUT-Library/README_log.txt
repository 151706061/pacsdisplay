Log of LUT-Library contributions
 - number in parenthesis indicates the number
   of monitors with uLR measurements
 - A g appended to the number indicates that
   a generic LUT is present.

Note: Several monitors return the model but not the manufacturer.
      The library stores these with just the model name
      which can be read using the loadLUT search option.
