The NEC MultiSync EA234WMi monitor uLR files were measured using
the following OSD settings:

    ECO MODE:        OFF
    AUTO BRIGHTNESS: OFF
    BRIGHTNESS:      100
    CONTRAST:        43
    BLACK LEVEL:     58
    DICOM SIM. MODE

Deviation from these settings will result in non-optimal performance
when using the LUTs generated from the uLR files.
