The Samsung 403T is a high brighness, wide format, 40 inch
LCD panel with 1280 x 768 format and about 500 cd/m2 brightness.
In 2003, four monitors were deployed in a Radiology conference
room at Henry Ford Health System. Paired monitors were
mounted (portrait) on the wall in front of two seating groups.
The podium has matching paired monitors with a 3rd navigation
monitor. In use, the person at the podium used a 3 monitor
PACS reading application and the audience views the clinical
images presented on the paired portrait monitors.

The four uLR data files in this library folder have the
luminance response for these monitors. Serial numbers
were not recorded. The files refer to North and South
pairs and the Right or Left unit (NR, NL, SR, and SL).
